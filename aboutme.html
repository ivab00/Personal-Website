<h1><strong>About Bre</strong></h1>

I graduated from Whitley County High School in 2018 and from <I>University of the Cumberlands</I> in 2022 with a degree in <bold>middle school math, elementary education with an emphasis in special education</bold>. I began teaching full-time at Whitley North Elementary School. I taught 5th grade special education this year.
